# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest-XGBoost-in-R-Prpogramming

## I have prepared this model in R using Random Forest & XGBoost. So, it is for those who are learning R or want to improve their machine learning skills...

## I have break this data in smaller data, as I was facing challenge to run huge data on my PC, so that processing notebook will not take too much of time, if you want to apply the code on the entire data it will give you better results, I have tested this model on many small data, I am sharing it with you. You can also do some manipulation in the selected hyperparameters to check how model is performing.

## I have used only Bitcoin as asset Id for my model preparation , you can use the same on entire data if you have more powerful machines. 

### Note : # If you are having computer with 8 GB RAM with i5 processor or below, better to use CAT Boost rather using models Random Forest or XGBoost, it will not run on your machine or take too long to process the code. In CAT Boost it will take less time but give 1-2% less accuracy then XG Boost.

## If you like the code , then give a upvote.. will boost me.. thanks a lot...
